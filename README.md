# Volunteers-Android

## Introduction

Volunteers Android  is a mobile application which helps manage the Hoppers at the Grace Hopper Celebration. We want to provide Systersâ€™s affinity groups a method of collaborating, organizing, and promoting their individual events (i.e. meetups, local workshops, etc). Systers can register, login, and volunteer for events in their local city. These volunteers work multiple shifts, up to eight hours, spread over the three days of the conference. They must commit to their assigned shifts, attend an orientation and be in the area during the conference week.


You can learn more about the Systers organization, whose members work on the development of this app [here](http://anitaborg.org/get-involved/systers/) and join our mailing list [here](http://systers.org/mailman/listinfo/systers)

## Troubleshooting/Issues

If there are any problems encountered when installing the IDE, you may want to check and make sure you have a JDK and JRE installed. If you experience trouble building or running the project, you may not have the necessary build tools, which you can download directly through the IDE. If the app does not run on the emulator, it may be that the emulator is too slow, and you should look into installing one from an outside source.
