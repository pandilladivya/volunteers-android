# Volunteers-Android

## Introduction

Volunteers Android  is a mobile application which helps to manage the Volunteers at an event. We want to provide Systersâ€™s affinity groups a method of collaborating, organizing, and promoting their individual events (i.e. meetups, local workshops, etc). Systers can register, login, and volunteer for events in their local city.

## Project Setup

This document should help to get the volunteers-android project up and running.

The project has been created using Android Studio.
Download [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html) and the required SDK tools or get the Eclipse ADT plugin

## Getting Started:

### Fork the Repository

- On GitHub, navigate to the [Volunteers-Android](https://github.com/systers/volunteers-android/) Repository.
- In the top-right corner of the page, click Fork.

### Clone the Repository

You get started by cloning the project to your local machine:

Go to your terminal and execute this command

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/volunteers-android

```
Here "YOUR_USERNAME" should be replaced with your actual user name in github!

or

You can directly clone the project into Android Studio.

```
File -> New -> Project from Version Control -> GitHub.
```

Then enter your github username and password. Select the repository and hit clone.
The github repo will be created as a new project in android studio.


## Opening and Running

5. If Gradle finishes to build without error run the project by clicking on the play button on the tool bar.
6. Wait for a few seconds and the app should start on your device(android phone or emulator)


## Troubleshooting/Issues

If there are any problems encountered when installing the IDE, you may want to check and make sure you have a JDK and JRE installed. If you experience trouble building or running the project, you may not have the necessary build tools, which you can download directly through the IDE. If the app does not run on the emulator, it may be that the emulator is too slow, and you should look into installing one from an outside source.

If there are any other questions or concerns, you can join #vola channel in our slack group.
